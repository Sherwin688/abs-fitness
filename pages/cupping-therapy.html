                        <b>Myo-Kinetic Cupping</b><br> is a specialized form of cupping therapy that focuses on
                        releasing muscle tension and promoting flexibility. During a Myo-Kinetic cupping session,
                        suction cups are strategically applied to specific muscle areas to help relax tight muscles,
                        improve blood flow, and enhance overall mobility. This therapy is often sought after by athletes
                        and individuals with muscular discomfort to help them recover and maintain peak physical
                        performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Static Cupping</b><br> involves placing suction cups on specific areas of the body to create
                        a gentle vacuum effect. This technique is primarily used to relieve muscle tension, increase
                        blood flow, and promote relaxation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dynamic Cupping</b><br> involves the use of suction cups that glide across the skin's surface. This technique helps stimulate circulation, release muscle knots, and improve flexibility. It's particularly effective for targeting larger muscle groups and promoting overall muscle health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dry Cupping</b><br> is a traditional form of cupping therapy where suction cups are placed on the skin to create a vacuum effect. This therapy is often used to alleviate muscle tension, improve blood flow, and promote relaxation. It's a non-invasive method that can provide relief for various health concerns
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Wet Cupping / Hijama</b><br>is a form of cupping therapy that involves creating small incisions on the skin after dry cupping and then applying suction cups to draw out a small amount of blood. It is believed to help remove toxins from the body and promote overall well-being. Wet cupping should be performed by trained professionals in a sterile environment to ensure safety and hygiene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Fire Cupping</b><br>uses heated glass or bamboo cups to create a vacuum when applied to the skin. The cups are  heated with an open flame before being placed on specific areas of the body. As the air inside the cup cools, it creates a suction effect, which can help with muscle tension, blood flow, and relaxation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dry Needling</b><br>Dry needling uses tiny needles in muscle knots to help with pain and movement. Trained experts safely ease muscle issues. It's good for different body problems, like pain and stiffness.
